For this assignment, you need to write two functions.public void drawTree( Graphics g, int x, int y )this functions must draw a tree on the screen. Use a brownish rectangle for the trunk, and a green triangle (using fillPolygon()) for the branches. You should make it so that x is the left-most part of the branches, and y is the tallest part of the tree. You should make each tree relatively small.public void drawForest( Graphics g, int x, int y, int w, int h )this functions should call the drawTree() method inside a loop in order to draw many trees within a certain region on the screen. The positions of the trees within the forest should be random, but no part of any tree should extend past the boundaries given
